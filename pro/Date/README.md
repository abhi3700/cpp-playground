Q. - Write a Date class to represent the calendar date. 

The class should include information about the day, month and year. 
The class must contain: 
- A constructor that takes three parameters corresponding to day, month, and year. 
- Member function for printing the date on the terminal. 
- Member functions for setting and retrieving dates. 
- Member functions to set and retrieve the month. 
- To set the date, create a function that takes two arguments and sets the day and month (respectively, and inserts a check 
for the number of days in the month). If you want to set only the month or day, then pass 0 as the argument, which remains the same. 
- Member functions to set and retrieve the year. 
- A member function that checks that one date is earlier than the other. 
- A member function that checks that one date is equal to the other. 

Write a simple program that asks the user for two dates, creates two corresponding Date objects, compares them, prints a message 
about what they are before the other or that they are equal, and outputs them both to the terminal)
